appsettings.json : all the secrets and connection string goes in here.

all the properties in a model class is basically the columns that we want in our database.

to add table in database we need to do migration ef core.

when creating HttpPost action we need to pass Model. So, when it is posted it will provide that form in the associated controller. And the obj has everything of that model.

[HttpPost]
public IActionResult \*\*\* (){ \* \*
return RedirectToAction("actionName","controllerName");
}

ModelState represents the state of the model binding process, which is used to validate and handle data coming from HTTP requests (like forms or JSON). It is a part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding namespace and plays a key role in determining whether the data sent to an action method is valid.
& IsValid is simply a condition.

a asp-controller="Category" asp-action="Edit" asp-route-id="@obj.Id"
class="btn btn-primary mx-2" // in this asp-route-id is to pass the id to the controller. tag-helper systax asp-route-/_anyname_/ = "@obj.\*\*"

if the action method has same name and parameter , we have to change name of post method and fo example if the action method name is delete .we have to explicitly tell here that name is delete for the endpoint in post method.

TempData only holds data till the next render.
